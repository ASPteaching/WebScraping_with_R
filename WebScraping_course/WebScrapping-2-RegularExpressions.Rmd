Introduction
=============

- Web scraping is about collecting information from the web.
- Sometimes this will be contained in tables or other well structured containers,
- But most of the times we need to gather relevant information from *heaps of unstructured textual data*.
- This is usually done in three steps
    1. Gather the unstructured text.
    2. Determine which recurrent *patterns* in the data are we looking for.
    3. Apply the patterns to the unstructured text to obtain the desired information.
- We focus on steps 2 and 3 and introduce **regular expressions** as the tool for optimally doing this processing.
- Regular expressions provide a syntax for systematically accessing and operating on text patterns.

When would one need regular expressions?
=======================================
- The example below shows a typical situation where regular expressions mat be useful: manipulating files by their names.
    + We are often faced with the problem of selecting/accessing a subset of files.
    + We can use string functions to extract certain (file)names, say all documents on a certain topic.
        * At a certain level standard string functions will be enough to describe the names we want to access: for example all files whose name includes the string  `dplyr`.
        * For more sophisticated extractions this will not be enough. Here is where regular expressions enter the game allowing to describe almost any pattern one can imagine.
- Regular expressions are throroughly used by system administrators to manage computer files.
- A different but related situation is when one whishes to extract meaningful (or "given") content from text.
    + Mining text to look for a certain type of expression
    + Mining twitter data
    
A simple example (1): files and datasets
==========================================
- We have selected a few files from:from [https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/STAT545-UBC.github.io](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/STAT545-UBC.github.io), where you can find a good tutorial on regular expressions, and have compressed them into a zip file: `regexExample1.zip`.
- We wish to locate all the files which deal with the `dplyr` package. We assume that these are file with the string "dplyr" inside their name.
- To do this we proceed as follows:

1. List all files in the folder where you uncompressed `"regexExample1.zip"`

```{r}
setwd("regexExample1")
files <- list.files()
setwd("..")
# head(files)
```

A simple example (2): File selection
===================================

- We can use `grep()` function to identify files whose name contains the string "`dplyr`". 
- If we set the argument `value = TRUE`, `grep()` returns the matches, 
 

```{r}
grep("dplyr", files, value = TRUE)
```

- If, instead, we set `value = FALSE`,  `grep()` returns their indices. 

```{r}
grep("dplyr", files, value = FALSE)
```

More `grep` flavors
====================
- The `invert` argument let's you get everything BUT the pattern you specify. 

```{r}
grep("dplyr", files, invert=TRUE, value = FALSE)
```

- `grepl()` is a dimilar to `grep` but returns a logical vector. See [here](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/grep) for more information. 

```{r}
grepl("dplyr", files)
```

So what are regular expressions?
=================================

- A *regular expression* is a special text string for describing a certain amount of text.
- This "certain amount of text" receives the formal name of *pattern*.
- A regular expression is a *pattern that describes a set of strings*.
- It is common to abbreviate the term "regular expression" as *regex*.
- Simply put, working with regular expressions is nothing more than *pattern matching*.

Forming regular expressions
=================================

- Regex patterns consist of a combination of *alphanumeric characters* as well as *special characters*.
    + e.g. [a-zA-Z0-9 .]*
- A regex pattern can be as simple as a single character.
- But it can also be formed by several characters with a more complex structure.
- Regular expressions are constructed from 3 types of components:
    + __*Literal characters*__ are matched only by the character itself.
    + __*Character classes*__, matched by any single member of the specified class
    + __*Modifers*__ that operate on literal characters, character classes, or combinations of the two.
    
String functions and patterns
=============================

- Notice that the enumeration above relies on two types of functions
    + Standard `base` R functions
    + Functions from the `stringr` package, developed for extending and simplifying R base functionalities.
- Information is available:
    + For base functions at:
[ENDMEMO/Regular Expressions in R](http://www.endmemo.com/program/R/grep.php)
    + For `stringr` at: [stringi regular expressions vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringr/vignettes/regular-expressions.html)
- All the functions require a pattern to describe the set of strings on which they operate.
- Regular expressions _*are not the functions but the rules used to build the patterns*_.

Common Regex tasks
===================

- **identify** match to a pattern: 
    + `grep(..., value = FALSE)`, `grepl()`, 
    + `stringr::str_detect()`
- **extract** match to a pattern: 
    + `grep(..., value = TRUE)`, 
    + `stringr::str_extract()`, `stringr::str_extract_all()`     
- **locate** pattern within a string, i.e. give the start position of matched patterns. 
    + `regexpr()`, `gregexpr()`, 
    + `stringr::str_locate()`, `string::str_locate_all()`    

Common Regex tasks (continued)
===================    
    
- **replace** a pattern: 
    + `sub()`, `gsub()`, 
    + `stringr::str_replace()`, `stringr::str_replace_all()`     
- **split a string** using a pattern: 
    + `strsplit()`, 
    + `stringr::str_split()`     
    
Regular expression syntax
==========================

- Regular expressions typically specify *characters* or *character classes* to seek out, possibly with information about repeats and location within the string. 
- This is accomplished with the help of metacharacters that have specific meaning: 
    + `$ * + . ? [ ] ^ { } | ( ) \`. 
- In this section, we will introduce the basic building blocks of extended regular expressions as implemented in R. 
- The following string will serve as a running example:
```{r}
example.obj <- "1. A small sentence. - 2. Another tiny sentence."
```

Syntax (1): Exact character matching
==========================================

- At the most basic level *characters match characters*, even in regular expressions. 
- Thus, extracting a substring of a string will yield itself if present:
```{r}
require(stringr)
str_extract(example.obj, "small")
```
Otherwise, the function would return a missing value:
```{r}
 str_extract(example.obj, "banana")
```

`grep` can also be used to exctract a match but it returns the whol sentence matching the pattern.
```{r}
grep("small",  example.obj, value=TRUE)
```

The `str_whatever` functions
=============================
- The `stringr` package offers both `str_whatever()` and `str_whatever_all()` in many
instances. 
    + The former addresses the first instance of a matching string,
    + the latter accesses all instances.
- The syntax of all these functions is such that:
    + the character vector in question is the first element, 
    + the *regular expression* the second, and 
    + all possible additional values come after that.
    
```{r}
require(stringr)
str_extract_all(example.obj,"e")
```

`str_extract` vs `grep`
=============================

- Observe the different result:

```{r}
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_extract(x, "an")
grep("an", x, value = TRUE)
```

- To obtain the same result as with grep one can use `str_detect`

```{r}
str_subset(x,"an")
```



Refining the search for a character (1) Specifying location
===========================================================
- Sometimes we do not simply care about finding a match anywhere in a string but are concerned about the *specific location* within a string.
- There are two simple additions we can make to our regular expression to specify locations. 
    + The caret symbol (^) at the beginning of a regular expression marks the beginning of a string
    + The dollar symbol ($) at the end marks the end.
  3 Thus,
extracting 2 from our running example will return a 2.

Syntax (2): Wildcards
=================================================================

- The power of regular expressions stems from the possibility to write *flexible, generalized search queries*. 
- Wildcards allow the search for any character
    + The most general among them is the period character, ".", that matches *any* character.
```{r}
str_extract(example.obj, "sm.ll")
example.obj.2 <- "The cat sat on the mat"
str_extract(example.obj.2, ".at")
str_extract_all(example.obj.2, ".at")
```


Syntax (3): Escape sequences 
===================================
- There are some special characters in R that cannot be directly coded in a string. 
- For example, let's say you specify your pattern with single quotes and you want to find countries with the single quote `'`. 
- You would have to "escape" the single quote in the pattern, by preceding it with `\`, so it's clear it is not part of the string-specifying machinery: 
```{r}
gDat <- read.delim("regexExample1/gapminderDataFiveYear.txt")
str(gDat)
grep('\'', levels(gDat$country), value = TRUE)
```

Syntax (3): More on Escape sequences 
===================================
- There are other characters in R that require escaping, and this rule applies to all string functions in R, including regular expressions. 
    * `\'`: single quote. You don't need to escape single quote inside a double-quoted string, so we can also use `"'"` in the previous example.        
    * `\"`: double quote. Similarly, double quotes can be used inside a single-quoted string, i.e. `'"'`.     
    * `\n`: newline.   
    * `\r`: carriage return.
    * `\t`: tab character.   
- See [here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Quotes.html) for a complete list of R esacpe sequences.  
-  Note: `cat()` and `print()` to handle escape sequences differently, if you want to print a string out with these sequences interpreted, use `cat()`.  

Syntax (4): Quantifiers
========================
- Sometimes we need to describe a sequence by the number of matches. This can be done using *quanitifiers*
- Quantifiers specify how many repetitions of the pattern.   
    * `*`: matches at least 0 times.   
    * `+`: matches at least 1 times.     
    * `?`: matches at most 1 times.    
    * `{n}`: matches exactly n times.    
    * `{n,}`: matches at least n times.    
    * `{n,m}`: matches between n and m times.  

Syntax (4): Quantifiers (examples)
=================================
    
```{r eval=FALSE}
(strings <- c("a", "ab", "acb", "accb", "acccb", "accccb"))
grep("ac*b", strings, value = TRUE) # "ab"     "acb"    "accb"   "acccb"  "accccb"
grep("ac+b", strings, value = TRUE) # "acb"    "accb"   "acccb"  "accccb"
grep("ac?b", strings, value = TRUE) # "ab"  "acb"
grep("ac{2}b", strings, value = TRUE) # "accb"
grep("ac{2,}b", strings, value = TRUE) # "accb"   "acccb"  "accccb"
grep("ac{2,3}b", strings, value = TRUE) # "accb"  "acccb"
```

**Exercise**

Find all countries with `ee` in Gapminder using quantifiers.   

Syntax (5): Position of pattern within the string 
=================================================
The "begin" or "end" location can be extended to any position of the string
  * `^`: matches the start of the string.   
  * `$`: matches the end of the string.   
  * `\b`: matches the empty string at either edge of a _word_. Don't confuse it with `^ $` which marks the edge of a _string_.   
  * `\B`: matches the empty string provided it is not at an edge of a word.    

```{r eval=FALSE}
(strings <- c("abcd", "cdab", "cabd", "c abd"))
grep("ab", strings, value = TRUE)
grep("^ab", strings, value = TRUE)
grep("ab$", strings, value = TRUE)
grep("\\bab", strings, value = TRUE)
```

**Exercise**
Find all `.txt` files in the folder.   

Syntax (6): Operators
=======================
- Regular expressions are composed using _*operators*_.
  * `.`: matches any single character, as shown in the first example. 
  * `[...]`: a character list, matches any one of the characters inside the square brackets. We can also use `-` inside the brackets to specify a range of characters.   
  * `[^...]`: an inverted character list, similar to `[...]`, but matches any characters __except__ those inside the square brackets.  
  * `\`: suppress the special meaning of metacharacters in regular expression, i.e. `$ * + . ? [ ] ^ { } | ( ) \`, similar to its usage in escape sequences. Since `\` itself needs to be escaped in R, we need to escape these metacharacters with double backslash like `\\$`.   
  * `|`: an "or" operator, matches patterns on either side of the `|`.  
  * `(...)`: grouping in regular expressions. This allows you to retrieve the bits that matched various parts of your regular expression so you can alter them or use them for building up a new string. Each group can than be refer using `\\N`, with N being the No. of `(...)` used. This is called __backreference__.   

Syntax (6): Operators examples
===============================

```{r eval=FALSE}
(strings <- c("^ab", "ab", "abc", "abd", "abe", "ab 12", "acb"))
grep("ab.", strings, value = TRUE)
grep("ab[c-e]", strings, value = TRUE)
grep("ab[^c]", strings, value = TRUE)
grep("^ab", strings, value = TRUE)
grep("\\^ab", strings, value = TRUE)
grep("abc|abd", strings, value = TRUE)
gsub("(ab) 12", "\\1 34", strings)
```
**Exercise**

Find countries in Gapminder with letter `i` or `t`, and ends with `land`, and replace `land` with `LAND` using backreference.  

```{r}
## [1] "FinLAND"     "IceLAND"     "IreLAND"     "SwaziLAND"   "SwitzerLAND"
## [6] "ThaiLAND"
```

Syntax (7): Character classes
===============================

- Character classes allows to -- surprise! -- specify entire classes of characters, such as numbers, letters, etc.
- There are two flavors of character classes, one uses `[:` and `:]` around a predefined name inside square brackets and the other uses `\` and a special character. They are sometimes interchangeable.   

    * `[:digit:]` or `\d`: digits, 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9, equivalent to `[0-9]`.  
    * `\D`: non-digits, equivalent to `[^0-9]`.  
    * `[:lower:]`: lower-case letters, equivalent to `[a-z]`.  
    * `[:upper:]`: upper-case letters, equivalent to `[A-Z]`.  
    * `[:alpha:]`: alphabetic characters, equivalent to `[[:lower:][:upper:]]` or `[A-z]`.
    * `[:alnum:]`: alphanumeric characters, equivalent to `[[:alpha:][:digit:]]` or `[A-z0-9]`.   
    * `[:blank:]`: blank characters, i.e. space and tab.  
    * `[:space:]`: space characters: tab, newline, vertical tab, form feed, carriage return, space.

More character classes
=======================

- Other character classes are described below:

    * `\w`: word characters, equivalent to `[[:alnum:]_]` or `[A-z0-9_]`.
    * `\W`: not word, equivalent to `[^A-z0-9_]`.  
    * `[:xdigit:]`: hexadecimal digits (base 16), 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F a b c d e f, equivalent to `[0-9A-Fa-f]`.
    * `\s`: space, ` `.  
    * `\S`: not space.  
    * `[:punct:]`: punctuation characters, ! " # $ % & ' ( ) * + , - . / : ; < = > ? @ [ \ ] ^ _ ` { | } ~.
    * `[:graph:]`: graphical (human readable) characters: equivalent to `[[:alnum:][:punct:]]`.
    * `[:print:]`: printable characters, equivalent to `[[:alnum:][:punct:]\\s]`.
    * `[:cntrl:]`: control characters, like `\n` or `\r`, `[\x00-\x1F\x7F]`.  

**Note**:       
    * `[:...:]` has to be used inside square brackets, e.g. `[[:digit:]]`.     
    * `\` itself is a special character that needs escape, e.g. `\\d`. Do not confuse these regular expressions with R escape sequences such as `\t`.      

General modes for patterns
===========================

- There are different [syntax standards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression#Standards) for regular expressions, and R offers two:
    * POSIX extended regular expressions (default)
    * Perl-like regular expressions.
  
- You can easily switch between by specifying `perl = FALSE/TRUE` in `base` R functions, such as `grep()` and `sub()`. 
- For functions in the `stringr` package, wrap the pattern with `perl()`. 
- The syntax between these two standards are a bit different sometimes, see an example [here](http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/stringr/docs/perl).
