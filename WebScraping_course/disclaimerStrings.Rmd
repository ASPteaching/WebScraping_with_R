- These slides have been prepared based on multiple sources: websites, blogs, courses. While it is hard to cite them all I wish to acknowledge those sources that have been particularly useful.

- This chapter makes a heavy use of strings so two additional sources are:

    + [Handling Strings with R](https://www.gastonsanchez.com/r4strings/) by Gaston Sanchez and
    + [R for Data Science (Strings chapter)](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html) by Hadley Wickham and Garret Grolemund.
